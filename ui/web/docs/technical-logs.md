## 2025-07-19: React Query with Axios Implementation

Implemented a scalable and type-safe React Query setup with Axios for handling multiple REST APIs. The implementation follows a layered architecture:

### Architecture Overview

1. **Axios Client Layer** (`lib/axios.ts`)
   - Created a base Axios instance with interceptors for authentication and error handling
   - Implemented automatic token injection from Supabase auth
   - Added error handling for common HTTP errors (401, etc.)

2. **API Service Layer** (`services/api.service.ts`)
   - Organized API endpoints into service classes (GithubService, AgentService, RepoService, PlanService)
   - Each service provides type-safe methods for interacting with the API
   - Implemented proper error handling and response typing

3. **React Query Hooks Layer** (`hooks/api/*`)
   - Created custom hooks for each API endpoint
   - Implemented proper query invalidation for mutations
   - Added support for dependent queries with the `enabled` option
   - Structured query keys hierarchically for efficient cache management

4. **Type Definitions** (`types/api.ts`)
   - Defined comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all API requests and responses
   - Re-exported existing types from the old API module for backward compatibility
   - Added generic response types for consistent error handling

### Key Improvements

- **Performance Optimization**: Configured React Query with appropriate stale times and garbage collection
- **Type Safety**: All API calls and responses are fully typed
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling at multiple levels
- **Caching**: Efficient caching strategy with proper invalidation
- **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns between layers
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new API endpoints following the established pattern
- **Developer Experience**: Simplified API usage in components with custom hooks

### Example Component

Created a `RepoList` component to demonstrate the usage of React Query hooks:
- Shows how to fetch data with `useRepos` and `useTrackingPlanEvents`
- Demonstrates how to use mutations with `useCloneGithubRepo`
- Implements loading and error states
- Shows how to handle dependent queries

### Documentation

Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/react-query-setup.md` explaining:
- The overall architecture
- How to use the hooks for data fetching and mutations
- The caching strategy
- Error handling approach
- How to add new API endpoints

This implementation provides a solid foundation for handling API calls in the application, with improved performance, type safety, and developer experience.
