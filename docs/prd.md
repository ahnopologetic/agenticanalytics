Looks like there was a hiccup with generating the document. No worries—I’ll keep things moving! Here’s what I’ll do:

I’ll post the complete PRD (section by section) right here, staying faithful to our outline and your notes.
If you want it in another format later, just let me know.
Let’s kick off with the PRD for Agentic Analytics:

Agentic Analytics – Product Requirements Document
TL;DR
Agentic Analytics is a rapid, code-integrated tracking plan automation tool for fast-moving startup teams. With a GitHub-first setup, it instantly turns codebase changes into actionable, shared analytics plans—bridging engineers, planners, and stakeholders with clear automated contracts. Implementation is lightweight and zero-bloat, delivering role-based insights and onboarding-to-value in under 5 minutes.

Goals
Business Goals
Achieve onboarding-to-first-value (usable tracking plan) in under 5 minutes for new teams.
Win early traction: 3+ unique team adoptions within first month of launch.
Reduce manual analytics gaps by 80% compared to current manual or ad-hoc setups.
User Goals
Eliminate context confusion: unify analytics language across engineers, planners, and stakeholders.
Automatically maintain and enforce tracking plans as the codebase evolves.
Provide live, role-specific feedback and nudges to keep product analytics accurate and trustworthy.
Non-Goals
No support for highly regulated or large enterprise environments at MVP.
Agentic Analytics will not serve as a full analytics dashboard or BI tool (e.g., complex charting/reporting beyond tracking plan).
No integrations beyond GitHub for MVP.
User Stories
Engineer (SWE):

As a SWE, I want to see new event requirements as I add/modify code, so I don’t forget analytics.
As a SWE, I want the tracking plan to stay up to date automatically as I make new PRs, so I spend less time in spreadsheets.
As a SWE, I want in-context error messages if I break analytics rules, so I can fix issues fast.
Planner/PM:

As a PM, I want to view what product metrics are tracked—and why—in human language.
As a PM, I want to request or review analytics events and receive notifications when action is needed from the engineering side.
As a PM, I want a clear audit trail of changes to the tracking plan.
Decision Maker:

As a decision maker, I want tracking plan enforcement to occur automatically, so I can trust product insights.
As a decision maker, I want onboarding to be instant with clear explanations.
As a decision maker, I want to see gaps/violations flagged—and confidently know who’s responsible to resolve them.
Functional Requirements
Tracking Plan Automation (High Priority)
Auto-generate initial tracking plan by parsing the GitHub-connected codebase.
Incrementally maintain the tracking plan as code changes (PRs, merges).
Enforce event schema/rules and notify for violations directly in GitHub PR checks.
Present tailored plans/views depending on user role (Engineer, PM, Decision Maker).
Integration (High Priority)
GitHub App/Action for seamless code integration.
PR check: Automated validation and inline feedback for analytics event consistency.
“Single sign-on” via GitHub for lean onboarding.
Admin & Settings (Medium/Low Priority)
Minimal configuration dashboard—just connect repo, choose main branch, and invite team (optional).
Basic opt-in notifications (optional for MVP).
User Experience
Entry Point & First-Time User Experience

User lands on web app, clicks “Connect with GitHub.”
Selects target repo; onboarding guide provides a quick walkthrough.
Backend scans repo, auto-generates (or updates) first tracking plan in <5 minutes—visual indicator shown.
Core Experience

Engineers: See inline PR feedback about event requirements, violations, and fixes.
PMs: Dashboard showing tracking plan, human-readable descriptions, and the ability to request/comment on events.
Decision Makers: High-level “health” indicator for tracking plan completeness, audit logs of recent changes.
Maintenance & Edge Cases

Tracking plan auto-updates as PRs merge—differences clearly highlighted.
If code changes can’t be auto-resolved or an event is ambiguous, user gets actionable suggestions (“Add event for onboarding flow”).
Simple error explanations and step-by-step fix flow.
UI/UX Highlights

Minimalist, clean, dark/light mode.
Role-based toggles for tailored information density.
Responsive and works well in browser plus GitHub integration UX.
Narrative
Meet a small startup team with no dedicated analyst. Their PM, Lee, is tired of trying to cobble together tracking spreadsheets. Developers resent last-minute requests to add missing analytics events before launches. The decision maker? More lost than anyone, with no confidence that the funnel metrics are even accurate.

One morning, Lee connects their product’s GitHub repo to Agentic Analytics. Within five minutes, a first draft tracking plan materializes—auto-surfaced from the existing code. Engineers see inline feedback in their PRs whenever events are missing or inconsistent. PM and stakeholders get a human translation: “This metric is tracked here, and here’s what it really means for the product.” No more muttered curses or last-minute demands.

As the product evolves, Agentic Analytics quietly maintains tracking plans—catching gaps, enforcing rules, and providing clear “who should do what” for any flagged issues. Ship velocity increases, team trust in analytics skyrockets, and product bets are finally data-backed. The team celebrates their new “F1 pitstop”—analytics maintenance is no longer a bottleneck, but a strategic advantage.

Success Metrics
User-Centric Metrics
Median time from repo connect to usable tracking plan: <5 minutes.
% of analytics gaps auto-resolved versus traditional/manual process.
Qualitative user satisfaction (“I get it!” factor from engineers/PMs in feedback).
Business Metrics
Number of active repos/teams in first three months.
Onboarding retention (teams coming back/continuing to use after setup).
Team expansion: # of roles using platform (not just SWE adoption).
Technical Metrics
GitHub Action PR check pass/fail rates.
System uptime >99%.
Majority of tracking plan code merges processed correctly on first try (>95%).
Tracking Plan (Key Events/Metrics)
Repo connected
First tracking plan generated
PR checks run
Tracking plan changes accepted/rejected
Technical Considerations
Technical Needs
GitHub API and Actions integration for repo access and PR checks.
Static/dynamic code parsing to auto-detect tracking events (start with one backend stack, e.g., JS/TS, for simplicity).
Simple back-end for plan storage and diffing (cloud DB, lightweight).
Simple web UI, designed for solo-builder velocity.
Optional: OAuth for secure GitHub login.
Integration Points
Only GitHub at MVP.
Encourage stateless/logless mode for privacy.
Data Storage & Privacy
Only stores code metadata and changes—never user data or PII.
No persistent analytics of end-users; focus is on event schema, not analytics data itself.
Scalability & Performance
Single-tenant, minimal server; multi-tenant path obvious for future.
Plan for parsing repos up to N MB without timeout.
Potential Challenges
Repo analysis accuracy for event extraction across languages.
Dealing with non-standard event naming/taxonomy.
Aligning PR checker with varying branching strategies.
Milestones & Sequencing
Project Estimate
Small—2–3 weeks for solo MVP.
Each phase offers real, usable results (no big-bang launches).
Team Size & Composition
Solo founder (you!)
Roles: Product, engineering, minimal design (reuse GitHub style where possible)
Suggested Phases
1. Core GitHub Integration and Tracking Plan Draft (1 week)

Backend connects to repo, parses code, creates first plan.
Simple front end to view/update plan.
Deliverable: Connect, parse, plan view—all working.
2. Role-Based View and Enforcement (1 week)

In-PR feedback via GitHub Action for code event checks.
UI surfaces engineering/PM split views and “who needs to act.”
Deliverable: Engineers get PR feedback; PM can comment/request.
3. UI Polish and Feedback Loop (up to 1 week)

MVP settings (invite team, opt-in notifications).
Polish flow, error states, satisfaction loop.
Deliverable: Ready for small-team onboarding, clean error handling, gather first user feedback.
