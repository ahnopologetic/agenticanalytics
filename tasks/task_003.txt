# Task ID: 3
# Title: Parse Codebase for Event Detection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement functionality to parse the connected codebase for tracking events based on predefined rules.
# Details:
1. Use a static code analysis library (e.g., Acorn for JavaScript/TypeScript) to parse the code. 2. Define rules for detecting event tracking patterns. 3. Store detected events in a temporary data structure for further processing.

# Test Strategy:
Run the parser on sample codebases and verify that it correctly identifies tracking events.
